# Cookie-Monster
Cookieless web viewer for sites that restrict use through cookies

Stupidly simple implementation of PyQt5 and WebEngine for a cookie-less web application. Includes small front-end splash screen using HTML and CSS with featured sites and a URL bar. No actual GUI at this point -- considering most sites allow you to get back to the home screen from any page, it's not really a problem.

Not really meant to be a browser, just a super simple way to read NYT or what-have-you.
